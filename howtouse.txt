gulp - common start dev-serv
gulp building - finish into dist directory
gulp sprite - if we need to transform all svg's into sprite
if we use sprite everywere in project, and we add some new svg's, we have to:
stop gulp(default)
if we already have directory(stack) and sprite.svg we have to remove it 
and after that we have to start: gulp sprite
when it's all done and we wanna build our project to '/dist' directory
we run: gulp build
